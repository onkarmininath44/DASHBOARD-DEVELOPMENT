## 1. üìå Objective

The goal of this project was to develop a **dynamic and interactive dashboard** using Power BI to visualize sales, profit, orders, shipping, and customer behavior for a retail business. The dashboard is intended to provide **actionable insights** to help in decision-making regarding product performance, customer segments, regional sales, and shipping performance.

## 2. üìÅ Dataset Overview

**File Used**: `Sample - Superstore.csv`
**Key Columns**:

* **Order Date, Ship Date** ‚Äì Date of order and shipment
* **Sales, Profit, Discount** ‚Äì Financial metrics
* **Product Name, Category, Sub-Category** ‚Äì Product hierarchy
* **Customer Name, Segment** ‚Äì Customer details
* **Region, State, City** ‚Äì Geographic breakdown
* **Order ID** ‚Äì Transaction-level identifier

## 3. üõ†Ô∏è Power BI Development Steps

### 3.1 Data Preparation (Power Query)

* Removed errors and ensured date formats were correct
* Cleaned null or missing values
* Created `minorderdate` and `maxshipdate` to define calendar range

### 3.2 Data Modeling

* Created a **Calendar Table** using DAX:

  ```DAX
  Calendar = CALENDAR(MIN(superstore[Order Date]), MAX(superstore[Ship Date]))
  ```
* Established relationships:

  * Active: `Calendar[Date]` ‚Üî `superstore[Order Date]`
  * Inactive: `Calendar[Date]` ‚Üî `superstore[Ship Date]`

### 3.3 DAX Measures

* **Revenue**:

  ```DAX
  Revenue = SUM(superstore[Sales])
  ```
* **Profit**:

  ```DAX
  Profit = SUM(superstore[Profit])
  ```
* **Orders**:

  ```DAX
  Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(superstore[Order ID])
  ```
* **Revenue by Ship Date** (using inactive relationship):

  ```DAX
  Revenue by Ship Date = CALCULATE(SUM(superstore[Sales]), USERELATIONSHIP(Calendar[Date], superstore[Ship Date]))
  ```
